## Case

A 3D-printable case, designed with OpenSCAD, to protect the edges of the pcb and prevent accidental contact to the pads on the back side.

Currently work-in-progress

## Thermal Notes

Since board temperatures can sometimes reach 60Â°C or possibly higher, it is important to choose a filament with high thermal resistance, such as [Colorfabb XT Black].
